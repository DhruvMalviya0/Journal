Instead, please report the vulnerability directly to the project maintainers:

2. Include step-by-step instructions or proof-of-concept code to reproduce the issue.
3. Allow up to **48 hours** for an initial response from maintainers.

## 🔒 Security Best Practices & Safeguards

1. **Session Cookies (`storageState.json`)**:
   - `storageState.json` contains sensitive Google session authentication tokens.
   - **Never commit `storageState.json` to version control.** It is strictly listed in `.gitignore`.
   - When deploying to CI/CD (GitHub Actions), encode the session to base64 (`base64 -w 0 storageState.json`) and inject it using encrypted Repository Secrets (`STORAGE_STATE_BASE64`).

2. **Personal Access Tokens (`GH_TOKEN`)**:
   - Limit token permissions to read-only commit access (`contents: read`).
   - Store GitHub tokens strictly in environment variables (`.env`) or GitHub Actions secrets.

3. **Masking Sensitive Outputs**:
   - Ensure logs, issues, and pull requests are sanitized to prevent accidental credential leakage.
